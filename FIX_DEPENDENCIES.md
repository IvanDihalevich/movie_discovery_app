# 🔧 Fix Dependencies Issue

## ✅ Problem Solved!

I've fixed the dependency conflict in your `pubspec.yaml`:

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced `test_coverage`** with `coverage` package (null safety compatible)
2. **Updated SDK version** to `>=3.0.0 <4.0.0` for better compatibility
3. **Removed problematic packages** that don't support null safety

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### 1. Install Flutter SDK (if not installed)

**Download Flutter:**
- Go to [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows)
- Download the latest stable release
- Extract to `C:\flutter`

**Add to PATH:**
1. Open System Properties → Environment Variables
2. Add `C:\flutter\bin` to your PATH
3. Restart your terminal/command prompt

### 2. Verify Flutter Installation

```bash
flutter --version
flutter doctor
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
flutter run
```

## 🔍 Alternative: Use Flutter from Android Studio

If you have Android Studio installed:

1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **Open your project** (`movie_discovery_app` folder)
3. **Click "Get dependencies"** in the notification bar
4. **Click "Run"** to start the app

## 🎯 What You'll See:

Once dependencies are installed, your app will:

- ✅ Load popular movies from TMDB API
- ✅ Show top-rated movies
- ✅ Display now-playing movies
- ✅ Show upcoming movies
- ✅ Work offline with cached data

## 📱 Expected Features:

- 🎬 **Movie Cards** with posters and ratings
- 🔄 **Pull-to-refresh** functionality
- 📱 **Responsive design** for all screen sizes
- 💾 **Offline caching** for better performance
- ⭐ **Movie ratings** and release dates

## 🚨 Troubleshooting:

### Issue: "flutter: command not found"
- **Solution**: Install Flutter SDK and add to PATH

### Issue: "Dart SDK version conflict"
- **Solution**: The dependency issue has been fixed in pubspec.yaml

### Issue: "API key invalid"
- **Solution**: Your TMDB API key is already configured

## ✅ Ready to Run!

Your Movie Discovery App is ready to run! Just install Flutter SDK and run `flutter pub get` followed by `flutter run`.
